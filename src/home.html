              mingle is an adventure game with horror elements, narrating the story of an ordinary individual who, due
              to mysterious circumstances, finds himself within a mobile simulation. Upon materializing in the house he
              had previously only observed on his smartphone screen, the protagonist experiences disorientation. Guided
              by the instructions of a device found in the bedroom, the bewildered man soon encounters a young woman
              whose likeness he recognizes from the mobile game.</p>

                  I initially thought this game looked cute and fun and that I'd enjoy the horror aspects it included, but was blown away at how well done this game is as a whole and am looking forward to it's replayability. AIHASTO did a fantastic job creating a single game with a clever exploration of nearly all game genres. The mini-games are simple yet fun and a nice break from the intensity of the main story. There are a lot of nice, small touches in every room or area you enter. I can't wait to explore everywhere in this game because of it. Thank you for making this game as I think I could easily claim it as one of my favorites!
